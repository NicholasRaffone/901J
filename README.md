# 901J's 2019 VEX Turning Point Code <br/>
## Coders: <br/>
	Joseph "Joey" Wildman (Team Captain)
	Nicholas "Nicholas" Raffone (Driver)
	Eric "the legend" Lee (Other)

As we have moved from VCS to Pros we have decided to document our code on GitHub for communication and fun. </br> 
Feel free to use our code as long as we don't face off during comps and if we do, you let us win.

Thanks;) 901J
